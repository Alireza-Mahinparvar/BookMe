Our team decided early on to meet online in order to complete the project. 
We broke down the milestone deliverable and then assigned parts to the team members. 
Members of the team were assigned to complete the Gantt chart predictions and plan the code necessary for implementation. 
Understanding this was just the basic HTML outline of the “Create Account” page, we broke down the provided code and planned out how we were going to execute.

Meeting on Friday, we were able to check the Gantt chart to ensure we were on schedule and discuss our pseudocode. 
Friday afternoon, we worked together to construct the “Create Account” web page and the corresponding Sphinx documentation. 
Each team member was able to commit their assigned aspect to the GitHub repository. 
We did spend a majority of Friday trying to perfect our code. 
Since we were unable to collaborate in person, this did take longer than expected, but we were able to get the webpage working as wanted. 
We spent most of Saturday and Sunday reviewing our HTML and Sphinx, pushing various commits to perfect our code.
Meanwhile, we kept an eye on our Gantt chart, making sure to update it as part of the project was complete.
