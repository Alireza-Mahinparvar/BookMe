Our team decided early on to meet online in order to complete the project. 
We broke down the milestone deliverable and then assigned parts to the team members. 
Members of the team were assigned to complete the Gantt chart predictions and plan the code necessary for implementation. 
Understanding this was just the basic HTML outline of the “Create Account” page, we broke down the provided code and planned out how we were going to execute. 
Meeting on Friday, we were able to check the Gantt chart to ensure we were on schedule and discuss our pseudocode. 
Friday afternoon, we worked together to construct the “Create Account” web page and the corresponding Sphinx documentation.
